## Description
SpaceGuard is an all-in-one anti-cheat, anti-alt, and general security mod for StarMade servers.

## Features
- **Alt Detection:** Blocks non-admin users from logging in under an alternate username.
- **VPN, Proxy, & TOR Detection:** Detects 98% of VPNs and blocks them.
- **Anti-Cheat:** Patches various exploits and vulnerabilities present in the base game.
- **Configurability:** SpaceGuard is designed to be highly customizable, and all of the above features can be toggled or configured via the mod's [configuration](https://github.com/garretreichenbach/SpaceGuard/wiki/Configuration).

## Planned Features
- **Discord Compatibility:** If configured, SpaceGuard will log any incidents in the configured staff channel so that admins can review it through Discord instead of in-game.

- **Suspicious Player Flagger:** Flags players that perform suspicious behaviors and logs incidents for admin review.
- **Silent Watch:** Allows an admin to observe a suspicious player directly without them knowing.
- **Inventory Viewer:** Allows an admin to view a player's inventory, as well as any inventory blocks they have accessed.
- **Invisible Eye:** Allows an admin to log in silently and invisibly.
- **Permissions System:** Allows owners to assign specific permissions and roles to certain players and restrict others.
- **Moderation Log:** Logs commands used by staff in a private staff channel.
