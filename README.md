# SpaceGuard
## Description
SpaceGuard is an all-in-one anti-cheat, anti-alt, and general security mod for StarMade servers.

## Features
- **Alt Detection:** Blocks non-admin users from logging in under an alternate username.
- **VPN, Proxy, & TOR Detection:** Detects 98% of VPNs and blocks them.
- **Anti-Cheat:** Patches various exploits and vulnerabilities present in the base game.
- **Client Mod Filter:** Allows servers to filter what client-side mods players are allowed to use, and can block unknown or suspicious mods. Bug Patches: Fixes misc. security-related bugs, exploits, and vulnerabilities present in the base game.
- **Suspicious Player Flagger:** Flags players that perform suspicious behaviors and logs incidents for admin review.
- **StarBridge Compatibility:** If StarBridge is installed, SpaceGuard will log any incidents in the configured staff channel so that admins can review it through Discord instead of in-game.
- **Data Encryption:** All packets sent to clients through SpaceGuard are encrypted using a serverside key unique to each server. Third-party mods can also utilize SpaceGuard's encryption via the [API](https://github.com/garretreichenbach/SpaceGuard/wiki/API).
- **Configurability:** SpaceGuard is designed to be highly customizable, and all of the above features can be toggled or configured via the mod's [configuration](https://github.com/garretreichenbach/SpaceGuard/wiki/Configuration).
